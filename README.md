### What is Realtional Database Management System?
**Ans.** A relational database management system or RDBMS is a database system that stores and fetches data in the form of tables. Thus the data is stored in the form of rows and columns.
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database engine/system based on the relational model specified by Edgar F.Codd--the father of modern relational database design--in 1970.
*For Example:* DBMS such as MySQL and ORACLE are based on the principle of relational DBMS.

Most modern commercial and open-source database applications are relational in nature. The most important relational database features include an ability to use tables for data storage while maintaining and enforcing certain data relationships.

### What is Relational Database?
**Ans.** A realtional database is a database which stores data in a tabular format. Tabular format means data is stored in table equipped with rows and columns.

*For Example:*

- *Tuple* - Each row of a Relation/Table is called Tuple.
- *Arity/Degree* - No. of columns/attributes of a Relation. E.g. - Arity is 5 in Table Student above.
- *Cardinality* - No of rows/tuples/record of a Relational instance. E.g. - Cardinality is 4 in table Student.
- *Domain* (set of permissible value in particular column) D is a set of atomic values. By atomic we mean that each value in the domain is indivisible as far as the formal relational model is concerned.
- A common method of specifying a domain is to specify a data type from which the data values forming the domain are drawn.
- E.g. <u>Names</u>: The set of character strings that represent names of persons.
